# Netherited

Ever wanted to save your all items from lava like you now can with your Netherite tools? Look no further! The Netherited mod adds the Fireproof enchantment which prevents any item that falls into lava or touches fire from disappearing.

## DEPENDENCIES
### Fabric

This mod needs to be downloaded alongside [NBT Crafting](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nbt-crafting) and [Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).
 

## HOW TO OBTAIN

To get a Fireproof Enchanted Book just place a book and a Netherite ingot in the Smithing Table. After getting it, apply it to any item you want with an anvil.

The items that cannot be applied with Fireproof are:

- Netherite Items

- Books (cannot get Fireproof itself, has to be enchanted in the smithing table).

- Shulker Boxes (WIP)
